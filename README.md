### Hi there! I'm Vitor Barboza 👋

**AI Engineer | LLMOps Specialist | Senior Data Scientist**

I specialize in bridging the gap between statistical modeling and production engineering—taking complex algorithms from **"notebook to production"** in secure, scalable cloud environments.

Currently, I lead advanced People Analytics and AI initiatives at **Vivo (Telefônica Brasil)**, architecting agentic workflows and predictive models. I am also a Master's Student in Computer Science (AI) at **Unicamp**.
